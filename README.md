# Arduino for Visual Studio Code

## Requirement

### Arduino
- [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)

Currently, the extension relies on the Arduino IDE. You should properly install the Arduino IDE and configurate the installation path.

- If the arduino command is already available from the command console, the extension will try to find probe the installation folder.
- And you can specify the Arduino installation path in the VSCode user setting files:

    ``` json
    {
        "arduino.path": "D:\\Develop\\arduino",
    }
    ```
